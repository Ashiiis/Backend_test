i have created a basic level api which satesfies all the requored conditions given
in the tesst questions .
for the authentication i used token based authentication system
in this a token is created for every user
The server sends the token back to the client as part of the authentication response.
The client stores the token locally (e.g., in memory, local storage, or a cookie).
and that token will be used further for downloading the files
i used JWT web token formate
